## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1. drpete.co/blog/25-point-website-usability-checklist
2. www.plerdy.com/usability-testing-website-checklist

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. A page's main text is concise and explanatory
2. Navigation labels are clear & concise
3. Adequate text-to-background contrast
4. Product image gallery; i.e., products have images and they're all presented together
5. Order confirmation to communicate to user that order was succesful
6. No accumulation of elements; i.e., leave adequate spacing between elements
7. Color standardization; something in an inconsistent color may be misconstrued as important
8. Full product information; user's need to be well-informed on what they're getting, or they won't order
9. Company logo is linked to homepage; this is consistent on webpages and expected
10. Number of buttons is reasonable; this is something we could work on
