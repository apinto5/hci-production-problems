  <h1>Seeking the familiar...</h1>
  <div class="bodyText">
    <p>Typeconnection's advice on seeking the similar states that matching a, g, and e's can imply a good match. Oswald's all look like a narrower carbon-copy of Open Sans'. The biggest noticeable difference is an angling of the line at the top of the lowercase g on Oswald, while it's flat in Open Sans. My other justifications for this pairing include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oswald and Open Sans were created to enhance legibility, particularly on digital devices; they're 'simplistic' with similar backgrounds.</li>
      <li>While the two fonts are very similar, the differences work well in complementing one another. Oswald looks narrower and slightly more eye-catching. Using similar fonts, with one acting as headers and titles is a winning strategy according to Typeconnection; Oswald is a clear contender for this.</li>
      <li>Alternate Gothic, which Oswald is a reworking of, is great for short, legible, yet powerful text. A famous use of it is for the Youtube logo. Meanwhile, Open Sans is great for longform text.</li>
