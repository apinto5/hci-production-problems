## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kV6MG03zuhjQtVffC++5r
Your Rationale: Gaming consoles have a pretty consistent aesthetic; a black or white, with a neon colored aesthetic. For the accent color, I used red; green looked better, but felt like it was encroaching too closely on the Xbox's design. As this is for a website, I included lighter colors -- likely a reddish white -- to avoid having only strictly harsh reds and blacks.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52B0I0kzGsW00Na0zse++9l++00
Your Rationale: The feeling of Spring, obviously, is evoked by greens; normally, this would lead me towards vibrant, bright greens. However, the Chicago Botanical Garden tends towards 'distinguished' marketing; i.e., sleek blacks and darker versions of colors. To confirm this, I went to their website; the greens they're using right now are all on the darker-end of green. I took this into account when making my palette. I included a yellow and blue, two other colors associated with springtime, via flowers and water, and light grays that are great for backgrounds for text. 

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet
